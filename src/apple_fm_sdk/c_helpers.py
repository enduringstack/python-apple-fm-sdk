"""
Internal C/Python interoperability helpers for Foundation Models.

This module provides low-level utilities for interfacing between Python and the
Foundation Models C/Swift implementation. It handles memory management, callback
registration, error handling, and type conversions across the language boundary.

.. warning::
    This module is for internal use only. The APIs in this module are not part
    of the public interface and may change without notice. Users should not
    import or use these utilities directly.

Key Components:
    - Memory management for C objects via :class:`_ManagedObject`
    - Callback registration and lifecycle management
    - Error extraction and conversion from C error codes
    - Streaming callback infrastructure

Memory Management:
    The module implements a reference counting system to ensure proper cleanup
    of C objects. Python objects that wrap C pointers inherit from
    :class:`_ManagedObject` which handles retain/release semantics compatible
    with Swift's ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).

Callback Safety:
    Python callback objects are registered in a global registry to prevent
    garbage collection while they're in use by C code. The registry uses
    thread-safe operations to handle concurrent access.

.. note::
    All C pointers passed from Swift to Python are assumed to be retained
    (ownership transferred). Python is responsible for releasing them exactly
    once when the object is deallocated.

    this class to ensure proper memory management across the Python/C boundary.

    The class follows these ownership rules:
    - When Swift passes a pointer via ``passRetained``, ownership is transferred to
      Python with a +1 reference count
    - Python must release the pointer exactly once when the object is deallocated
