# Foundation Models SDK for Python

Python bindings for Apple's [Foundation Models framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels), providing access to the on-device foundation model
at the core of Apple Intelligence on macOS.

## Overview

The Foundation Models SDK for Python provides a Pythonic interface to Apple's Foundation Models framework.

You can:

- **Evaluate Swift Foundation Models app features** by running batch inference and analyzing results from Python
- Perform **on-device inference** with the system foundation model
- Stream **real-time text generation** responses
- Use **guided generation** with structured output schemas and constraints
- Get **type-safe responses** using Python decorators for guided generation
- Configure **custom model settings** for different model options
- Process **transcripts exported from Swift apps** for quality analysis

Keep in mind that it's your responsibility to design AI experiences with care.
To learn about practical strategies you can implement in code, **check out:**

and Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines on Generative AI](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/generative-ai).

## Requirements

## Installation

Foundation Models SDK for Python is currently in Beta. Install using the development installation
instruction below.

## Basic usage

```python
import apple_fm_sdk as fm

# Get the default system foundation model
model = fm.SystemLanguageModel()

# Check if the model is available
is_available, reason = model.is_available()
if is_available:
    # Create a session
    session = fm.LanguageModelSession()

    # Generate a response
    response = await session.respond("Hello, how are you?")
    print(f"Model response: {response}")
else:
    print(f"Foundation Models not available: {reason}")
```

### Development Installation

If you need to modify the SDK or install from source:

1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple/python-apple-fm-sdk
cd python-apple-fm-sdk
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Make a virtual environment. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (or your package manager of choice) then:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package locally in editable mode:

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
```

4. After making any change, be sure to build the project again and test:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
pytest
```
